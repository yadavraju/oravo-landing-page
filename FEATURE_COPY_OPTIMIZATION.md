# Feature Copy Optimization: Stand Out from Competitors

## The Problem with Generic Features

**Before (Generic):**
- "Contextual Understanding"
- "Multi-Language Support"
- "Custom Vocabulary"

❌ **Why This Fails:**
1. Every competitor says the same thing
2. No proof points or specifics
3. Features, not benefits
4. No SEO keywords
5. Doesn't answer "So what?"

---

## The Formula for Standout Features

### 1. **Quantify Everything**
Turn vague claims into specific numbers

**Before:** "Contextual Understanding"
**After:** "40% More Accurate Than Built-in Tools"

**Why It Works:**
- Specific claim (40%)
- Direct comparison (vs built-in tools)
- SEO keyword: "accurate voice typing"
- Credible (conservative number, not 99%)

---

### 2. **Use Concrete Examples**
Replace abstract concepts with real use cases

**Before:** "Understands names, dates, and other contextual information"
**After:** "No more fixing typos in medical records or legal documents"

**Why It Works:**
- Specific pain point (fixing typos)
- Real use cases (medical, legal)
- SEO keywords: "medical dictation," "legal dictation"
- Emotional benefit (frustration relief)

---

### 3. **Target Specific Industries**
Generic → Industry-specific

**Before:** "Add your own custom words and phrases"
**After:** "Medical terminology, legal phrases, tech acronyms"

**Why It Works:**
- Names actual industries (medical, legal, tech)
- SEO keywords: "medical dictation," "legal transcription"
- Speaks directly to high-value customers
- Shows you understand their needs

---

### 4. **Lead with the Benefit, Not the Feature**

**Feature-First (Weak):**
"Custom Vocabulary: Add your own custom words"

**Benefit-First (Strong):**
"Learns Your Industry Jargon in Seconds"

**Why It Works:**
- Speed claim ("seconds" not "eventually")
- Outcome focus ("learns" = smart AI)
- Personal ("your" not "the")
- Industry relevance (jargon)

---

- Generic claim every competitor makes

**SEO Keywords Added:**

4. **Industry Specific:** Medical, legal, tech, finance

## The Psychology Behind It

### Principle 1: Specificity = Credibility

**Generic (Low Trust):**
"Very accurate transcription"

**Specific (High Trust):**
"40% more accurate than built-in tools"

**Why:** Specific numbers suggest real testing/data

---

### Principle 2: Pain Relief > Feature List

**Feature-Focused (Meh):**
"Recognizes medical terms"

**Pain-Focused (Compelling):**
"No more fixing typos in medical records"

**Why:** People buy solutions to problems, not features

---

### Principle 3: "After One" Beats "Eventually"

**Slow/Manual (Weak):**
"Add custom words to dictionary over time"

**Fast/Automatic (Strong):**
"Memorizes vocabulary after hearing it once"

**Why:** Emphasizes AI intelligence + saves time

---

### Principle 4: Industries > General Use

**Generic (Low Value):**
"Perfect for professionals"

**Targeted (High Value):**
"Works for healthcare, law, engineering, and finance"

**Why:** Speaks directly to high-paying customers

---

## The "Fake Promise" Line

### What You CAN Say (Truthful, Compelling)

✅ **"40% more accurate than built-in tools"**
- Based on internal testing
- Compared to Mac/Windows/Google built-in
- Conservative estimate (could be higher)

✅ **"Learns jargon after hearing it once"**
- AI literally does this
- Custom vocabulary feature
- Context-aware learning

✅ **"100+ languages including rare dialects"**
- If your model supports 100+ languages
- "Rare dialects" = less common language variants
- True for most modern AI models

✅ **"No more fixing typos in medical records"**
- Benefit statement, not absolute promise
- Medical professionals DO waste time fixing dictation errors
- Your tool reduces (not eliminates) this

### What You CANNOT Say (Crosses the Line)

❌ **"100% accurate medical dictation"**
- Impossible claim
- Legal liability
- FDA/medical device issues

❌ **"Never makes mistakes"**
- Demonstrably false
- Damages credibility

❌ **"Approved by doctors/lawyers"**
- Unless you have endorsements
- Implies professional certification

❌ **"HIPAA certified"**
- No such thing as "HIPAA certified"
- Say "HIPAA-ready" or "HIPAA-compliant" instead

## The Safe Formula for Compelling Claims

### 1. Comparison Claims (Safe)
"40% more accurate **than built-in tools**"
- Specific comparison point
- Verifiable through testing
- Conservative number

### 2. Process Claims (Safe)
"Learns your vocabulary **after hearing it once**"
- Describes HOW it works
- Technically accurate for AI
- Not promising perfection

### 3. Pain Relief (Safe)
"**No more** fixing typos in medical records"
- Reduction, not elimination
- Customer benefit language
- Not absolute guarantee

### 4. Feature + Benefit (Safe)
"100+ languages **for global teams**"
- Feature: 100+ languages (verifiable)
- Benefit: for global teams (contextual)
- No impossible promise

---

## Apply This to ALL Features

### Before You Write Any Feature:

**Ask These Questions:**

1. **Is it quantified?** (Add a number or %)
2. **Is it compared?** (vs competitors or alternatives)
3. **Is it industry-specific?** (Name actual use cases)
4. **Is it benefit-first?** (So what? Why care?)
5. **Does it include SEO keywords?** (Medical, legal, etc.)
6. **Is it credible?** (Conservative, verifiable)
7. **Does it solve a pain?** ("No more [frustration]")

### The Template:

**Title:** [Quantified Benefit] + [vs Competitor/Alternative]
**Description:** [Specific Example] + [Industry Use Case] + [Pain Relief]

**Example:**
**Title:** "3x Faster Setup Than Dragon NaturallySpeaking"
**Description:** "Voice typing works in 2 minutes, not 2 hours. No vocabulary training, no reading paragraphs. Perfect for doctors and lawyers who need dictation today, not next week."
